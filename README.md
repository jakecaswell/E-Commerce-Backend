## Installation
Clone the repo and when you open it up inside your code editor run "npm i" to install the necessary packages.

## Usage
Open the command line and run the command "npm start" or "node server.js" after cd'ing into the develop folder. After you have the server running, run either postman or insomnia, and you can then test out the routes. Either getting different information, creating and updating information, or deleting things from your database if you no longer wish to have those.
